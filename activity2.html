    <h3>Messi</h3>
    <p>Lionel Messi is the GOAT because of his unmatched playmaking, dribbling, and ability to control the entire game. Unlike Ronaldo, who thrives on finishing, Messi creates chances, assists, and scores with equal brilliance. His World Cup win with Argentina in 2022 gave him the ultimate achievement Ronaldo has yet to earn. Messi has more Ballon d'Or awards, showing consistent recognition as the best player in the world. Overall, Messiâ€™s all-around skill, vision, and football intelligence make him greater than Ronaldo.</p>
